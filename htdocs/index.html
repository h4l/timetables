			<h1>Lecture Listings</h1>
			<p>
Information about lectures provided by Faculties for the academic year 2012-13 is available here, either in the form of direct links to Faculty or departmental websites, or for subjects participating in the pilot system, a calendar version which can be viewed as a report, a weekly timetable or added to your own calendar by clicking the relevant link on a timetable's page.

			</p>
			<p>
				Information is accessed via the drop-down boxes, and is presented under the Faculty responsible for the course, with the exception of the Natural Sciences and Medical 
				and Veterinary Sciences Triposes which have their own listings. An additional drop-down box lists all courses in alphabetical order with MPhils grouped together.
			</p>
			<h2>Natural Sciences Tripos Part IA and Part IB</h2>
			<p>
				Please note that timetables include all possible practicals; for Part IA you will be allocated to particular slots according to your choice of subjects, for Part IB 
				you will arrange specific times during introductory sessions on 2nd &amp; 3rd October.
