NOTE THE TERM DROPDOWN IS MISSING FROM THE LAYOUT SCREENSHOT: THAT IS A MISTAKE.

The top of the calendar page is driven by a call to server/top. This returns json per top.json, and is used to drive the top
strip. The top strip has four dropdowns, year, tripos and part and term, and a multiselect component (course). 
year, part and tripos are driven from top. Terms is fixed. top.json provides an ordered list of years containing an ordered 
list of triposes, containing an ordered list of parts. Each pair has an ID, known as the tripospart id.

The final multi-select component can be implemented however is best in UI terms (it's difficult being a horizontal space) but
needs to allow the user to select arbitrary combinations. There may well often be about 20 to choose from. These are recoverable 
from server/calendar/<id> where id is the tripospart id of the currently selected tripos/part/year as given in top.json. 
A typical result is given in calendar.json, and this is the same data used to populate the calendar (separate spec), but you can
ignore everything except the values in the "courses" key, which lists all courses, their names and IDs, for the multiselect
component. You can ignore the keys to courses, which is just a repitition of the id.

By default (eg when just loaded and after change of tripos/year/part) all should be ticked.

The purpose of this topbar process is to give you a list of selected courseids (which are the ids inside the calendar.json)
which you can then use to query to build the calendar.

See the screenshot in calendar-popup for an example.
