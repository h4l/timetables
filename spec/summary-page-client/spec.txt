The summary page is the page you get to from the edit details popup and then click on the secont tab (suggest tab is called
"Detailed Descripiton"). For this you go to a server URL server/details/<id> where <id> is supplied, and you will receive 
something like details.json in the details-page folder.

You can ignore everything except the "title" (which should be displayed and editable), "orgainizer" and "where" (ditto), and
the metadata hash. Each value in the metadata hash should be displayed with a rich textarea next to it, pupulated with the
value. The title of the section should be derived from the key by replacing - and _ by space and uppercasing each word's
first letter. The order should be fixed for known keys, and other keys can be added in alphabetical order. The known keys
are "notes" and "course description", in that order. In the example supplied there's one other entry, "special-instructions", 
which should be displayed below, in a section "Special Instructions".

Saving should return the same blob, but with values updated, including all the fields ignored by this page. Update is by post
to the same URL, as it is for the details page.

The attached should give you an example of the layout, and the values should be per the details.json file.
