The popup appears when you select a rectangle from the calendar. It should, therefore, always be aware of a course id
context in which it operates, if editing an existing course, or else represent course which has just been dragged out.

In the case of an existing course, a call to server/details/<id> and returning data per details.json will supply values for
the fields in the popup. Course represents the name of the course, and is pulled from the top level name field, ditto
organiser and where. All three are blank for new creations. The type dropdown should have some default options: "lecture",
"lab", "field trip" and "examples class" and also an option "other" which turns it into a text entry box to allow freeform
entry. 

Terms and weeks can be pulled from the values in the relevant fields in the calendar JSON of the rectangle corresponding to the
popup. Note that it's possible for weeks to contain very large values. In this case, disable the week selector and pass the
values for week through unaltered. The term selector should have tickboxes for Michaelmas, Lent and Easter (0,1,2), all of 
which should be ticked by default (eg new creation), and the weeks selector for weeks 0-9, but only 1-8 selected by default 
(eg new creation).

All of the values in the popup are saved by updating the values to the relevant JSON in the calendar.json and updating it by
posting to the URL it was GET-ted from.

The details button should open the summary/details page using the course id in hand.

Ommitted from the pdf, but should be present, is a delete button in the popup to remove a rectangle all together.
