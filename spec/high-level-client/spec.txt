There should be a front page which has a selector at the top for tripos and part, driven by top.json. The client will have to
do some work to top.json, as any tripos and part which occur in any year should be present, but only once.

Underneath should be a list of links, one per course, again including all courses in any years. These links should hide divs
which contain lists of years for which the course occurs and links on each row of the list to the michaelmas, lent, and easter
calendars. See attached pdf for example. All this should be drivable from top.json.

The layout of the pages of Mercury is a sequence from the fron page to the cdalendar page and then to a join, tabbed Summary 
and Details page. See attached pdf.


Overall there are three json feeds from the server

server/top -- top.json -- contains the tripos/year/part structure for the dropdowns. Static. Cannot be updated.

server/calendar/<tripospartid> -- calendar.json -- contains info on the courses in a tripos and the rectangles to draw on the
calendar. Update when calendar changes, reload with different parameters on topbar changes. Update when rectangles move or the
popup cahnges.

server/details/<courseid> -- details.json -- contains the details about a course. Update when the course details change.
