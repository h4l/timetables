The ping system is used to deploy messages and to force updates on users. It is designed to be used in conjunction with mod_pagespeed, or similar. 

The ping system's main method is a periodic request sent by clients to the server whenever they are on a page. They are returned a payload which contains (at the moment) up to three things:

  i. any message to be displayed via an alert box;
  ii. a command to force any receiver to return to the login page;
  iii. the time to the next ping.
  
The time to ping is controlled by the config (config/config.txt, I think). During changes it can be ramped down to ensure responsiveness; during normal operation it can be ramped up again to reduce load. Sending a reset is also something controlled from the config. The motd's are set by files in the data directory which are set by hand: this includes a key to identify the message and distinguish it from all others. It should be unique throughout time (eg include datestamp). Local storage on the client uses this key to ensure a message is only displayed once. See web/php/ping.php for details, it's very simple. For example:

  echo -n 'This is a message' >data/msg_test_201111221340.txt
  
Delete it when you are done.
